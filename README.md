# Spam_classifier
Filtering spam messages using different classification algorithm and natural language processing

**DataSet**: Dataset is a collection of sms and their labels as ham or spam. The dataset is collected from UCI Machine Learning Repository. A collection of 425 SMS spam messages was manually extracted from the Grumbletext Web site. This is a UK forum in which cell phone users make public claims about SMS spam messages, most of them without reporting the very spam message received. The identification of the text of spam messages in the claims is a very hard and time-consuming task, and it involved carefully scanning hundreds of web pages.

The collection is composed by just one text file, where each line has the correct class followed by the raw message. We offer some examples bellow:
